Stochastic optimization is a branch of optimization that deals with finding the optimal solution to a problem in the presence of uncertainty or randomness. It is particularly useful when dealing with complex systems that involve random variables or noisy data, making traditional deterministic optimization techniques less effective.

The goal of stochastic optimization is to find the best possible solution that maximizes or minimizes the expected value of the objective function, taking into account the underlying probability distribution of the random variables. Unlike deterministic optimization, the solution obtained in stochastic optimization is typically a stochastic process, rather than a fixed point, because it incorporates the randomness inherent in the problem.
